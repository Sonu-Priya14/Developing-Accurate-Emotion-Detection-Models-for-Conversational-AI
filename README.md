# Developing Accurate Emotion Detection Models for Conversational AI

This repository contains the code, models, and datasets used for my Master's thesis: **"Developing Accurate Emotion Detection Models for Conversational AI."**  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The objective of this work is to build and evaluate deep learning models for emotion detection in conversational AI. The study compares four models:
- **CNN-GRU**
- **CNN-BiGRU**
- **CNN-LSTM**
- **CNN-BiLSTM**  

Through extensive experimentation, CNN-BiLSTM was identified as the best-performing model, while CNN-LSTM showed the least effectiveness.
